# Lab | Jupyter Notebook

## Introduction

Creating a Jupyter notebook that is well commented and tells the story of your code / project is very important.

## Getting Started

Create a jupyter notebook file `main.ipynb` in the `your-code` directory. Inside the file you should do the following steps:

- In the notebook that you created, introduces someone and her/his holidays preference with a picture and a link to a youtube video of this holiday preference (It can be you :D).
- Explain the purpose of the notebook with beautiful markdown!
- Write a function that inputs the user's name (You or a friend)
- Add a photo of you or that firend.
- Write a function that inputs their holidays preference.
- Add a photo of you or that firend in the holiday destination 
- Add bullet points of the top 3 things that you or your friend like doing in this destination.
- Try to make the text colorful, bold or italic.
- Add a link to a youtube video of the destination.

## Deliverables

- `main.ipynb` with your responses.

## Submission

Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
